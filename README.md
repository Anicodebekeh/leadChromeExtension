# leadChromeExtension

This Chrome extension has a client save, post and delete post/Urls while surfing the net.
it helps a marketer most especially keep track of e-mails address and white he/she would want to revisit and also take down relevant notes in order to boast productivity.
when an input is save, it is then committed to the local storage for future reference. However, i made provision for a delete button which wipes all the saved input
giving a clean slate to work on.

# leadChromeExtension

This Chrome extension helps client save, post and delete post/Urls while surfing the net.

it helps a marketer most especially keep track of e-mails address he/she would want to revisit and also take down relevant notes in order to boast productivity.

when an input is save, it is then committed to the chrome local storage for future reference. However, i made provision for a delete button which wipes all the saved input giving a clean slate to work on.
